<h1>Unknown Sides of Turtle Threats</h1>
<p>Six of the seven species of sea turtles are considered threatened or endangered across the globe as a result of human behavior and way of life.<br>
    There are many ways that people harm these animals, from people catching them with fishing gear to people eating their meat and eggs.</p>
</section>


<!--Bycatch-->
<section class="threat1">
    <h1>1.Bycatch</h1>
    <div class="threat1-col">
        <img src="bycatch.jpg" alt="#" class="center"> 
    </div>
        <div class="threat1-col">
            <p>
                Bycatch poses a serious threat to turtle populations and has an enormous effect on them. 
                Bycatch is the term used to describe non-target species accidentally caught during fishing operations, such as turtles.</p>

       <p>Mortality: Turtles can get hurt or killed when they get tangled up in fishing nets, lines, and other equipment. 
        In particular, if they get caught in submerged nets or longlines, they risk drowning if they are unable to breathe at the surface. 
        Turtles are particularly at risk from large-scale fishing operations like trawlers because of the extensive usage of nets that can catch and drown them.</p>
           
        <P>Population loss: Bycatch is a factor in the worldwide loss of turtle populations. Due to their slow growth rates and lengthy life spans,
             many turtle species are especially susceptible to high bycatch mortality rates. 
            A population's long-term viability can be significantly impacted by the death of just a few people.</P>
           
            <h2>The way to reduce the Threat</h2>
            <p>A mix of conservation measures, new fishing methods, and awareness campaigns are needed to reduce the hazard of bycatch on turtles.
                Around the world, initiatives are being taken to lessen bycatch and its effects on turtles. These include encouraging the use of more selective and sustainable fishing techniques, developing and using turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in fishing nets, and altering fishing tactics to reduce contacts with turtles.
                Governments, fishing companies, and conservation groups are working together to improve fishing techniques and increase public awareness in order to safeguard these threatened species from bycatch.

<!--Climate Change-->
<section class="threat2">
    <h1>2.Climate Change</h1>
    <div class="threat2-col">
        <img src="climatechange.webp" alt="#" class="center">

        <div class="threat2-col">
            <p>
                Climate change poses significant threats to turtles and their habitats.</p>

       <p>Sea Level Rise: Due to the melting of the polar ice caps and the thermal expansion of the ocean due to climate change, sea levels are increasing. 
        Sea turtle breeding beaches may disappear or erode as a result of sea level rise. 
        Turtles may not be able to lay their eggs, hatch, or successfully emerge from the sand if nesting locations are submerged.</p>
           
        <P>Extreme weather phenomena, such hurricanes, cyclones, and storms, are becoming more common and intense as a result of climate change. 
            These occurrences have the potential to wipe out turtle nesting sites, wash away eggs, and result in mortality in both adult turtles and hatchlings. 
            They interfere with migration patterns and affect the accessibility of food sources.</P>
           
            <h2>The way to reduce the Threat</h2>
            <p>These concerns from climate change can affect turtle populations cumulatively and synergistically with other stresses. 
                Reduced greenhouse gas emissions, conservation and restoration of essential turtle habitats, and the employment of adaptive management techniques to 
                safeguard and support turtle populations as they deal with shifting environmental factors are all part of attempts to lessen the effects of climate change.<br>
                Always keep in mind that while individual acts are crucial, systemic change is equally essential. We can significantly lessen the risks posed by climate change by 
                promoting stricter climate regulations, encouraging the development of renewable energy sources, and working together.</p>

<!--Illegal wildlife-->
<section class="threat3">
    <h1>3.Illegal wildlife trades </h1>

            <p>
                Illegal wildlife trade has a detrimental impact on turtles and their populations.</p>

       <p>Turtles are frequently hunted for their numerous body parts, including their shells, bones, meat, and eggs, which are used in some cultures for both traditional medicine and cultural beliefs. 
        Turtle poaching and trafficking are caused by the illegal trade that is fueled by the demand for these goods. 
        It is possible for turtle populations to dwindle or even go extinct locally as a result of the severe pressure this exploitation places on them.</p>
           
        <P>Turtles are traded for their shells, which are then used to create jewelry, decorations, and decorative objects. 
            These products are in high demand, especially those derived from threatened or endangered turtle species, which encourages 
            illegal trading and unsustainable turtle harvesting.</P>
           
            <h2>The way to reduce the Threat</h2>
            <p>Strict law enforcement, global collaboration, educating people about the negative effects of illegal trade, 
                and advocating sustainable alternatives are all part of the fight against illegal wildlife trade and efforts to safeguard turtles. 
                To lessen the demand for turtles caught in the wild, conservation organizations and governmental organizations collaborate to put into action strategies like 
                tightening up the law, enhancing border security, assisting in local conservation efforts, and encouraging responsible pet ownership. Furthermore, 
                outreach and education initiatives seek to educate the public on the value of protecting turtle populations as well as the detrimental 
                effects of the illegal wildlife trade.
