                The Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a type of sea turtle that can be found in all oceans, including Sri Lanka's coastal waters. 
                Their green body fat, which results from their herbivorous diet of seagrasses and algae, gives them their name.</p>

       <p>One of the biggest species of sea turtles is the green turtle, which may grow to a maximum adult weight of 500 pounds and a maximum length of 5 feet.
        They feature an oval-shaped, smooth shell that can be any color from olive to black, a flattened body, huge flippers, and large flippers.</p>
            <h3><U>REKAWA BEACH</U></h3>
        <P>The southern shore of Sri Lanka's Rekawa Beach is well known for the presence of green turtles there.
            It is one of the most significant nesting locations in Sri Lanka for green turtles, and during the nesting season, which lasts from April to September, tourists may see the turtles coming ashore to lay their eggs.

            <P>Under Sri Lankan law, Rekawa Beach is a protected area, and initiatives have been taken to preserve it as a crucial sea turtle breeding location. 
                A turtle conservation project has been developed in Rekawa by local conservation organizations and authorities. 
                It involves monitoring and guarding the nesting turtles and their eggs as well as educating the local population and tourists about the 
                value of sea turtle protection.</P>
