<h1>BENTOTA TURTLE HATCHERY</h1>
<p>To prevent the extinction of the turtles, the Sri Lankans established the Turtle Hatchery.<br>
    In the past, people—typically fishermen—would gather turtle eggs and sell them to anyone willing to pay a greater price.<br>
    These eggs were fed and cared for after the turtle hatchery opened until they were 2 to 4 years old. </p>

    <p>The Sea Turtle Hatchery is a turtle conservation facility situated along the Indian Ocean shore in Kosgoda, 9 kilometers from Bentota Railway Station.
        During your trip to Sri Lanka, it is one of the places you really must see in Bentota.</p>
<br>
         <p>Dudley Perera initiated the Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Project in 1981. 
            The project's primary goal is to preserve sea turtles and safeguard them against raptors like birds, dogs, and crabs. 
            It is one of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka specialized to raising this threatened species properly. 
            Out of the seven species of margin turtle found worldwide, visitors can view up to five endangered kinds in one location. 
            The location is ideal for children in particular, but it offers everyone a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
<br>
            <p>In order to ensure that any mother turtles have suitable conditions to lay eggs, the volunteers patrol the beach at night. 
                They also transport the eggs back to the hatchery to ensure proper hatching without predator injury, and once fully hatched, 
                they release the young sea turtles back into the ocean. They also care for disabled sea turtles and treat those that have grown frail as a result 
                of fishing activity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When visiting the hatchery, visitors will receive instructions on how to preserve the sea turtles and ensure that they are properly hatched.
                     When the baby turtles are released into the ocean in the evening, visitors can also go to the hatchery because there is less of a risk from 
                     predators and they can participate in the release of a newborn sea turtle.
                </p>
                <br>
               <p>Timings: 8.30 AM - 5.30 PM, Turtle Releasing - 6.30 PM</p> 
               <br>
